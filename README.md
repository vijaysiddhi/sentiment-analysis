Sentiment Analysis Project o
1. Data Collection:

Source: Collect Amazon reviews dataset.
Format: Ensure data is in CSV format with relevant columns like Review, Rating, etc.
2. Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning: Remove duplicates, null values, and irrelevant characters.
Tokenization: Split text into individual words or tokens.
Stop Words Removal: Eliminate common words (e.g., "the", "and") that do not contribute to sentiment.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualization: Use plots to understand the distribution of review ratings and word frequencies.
Word Clouds: Generate word clouds to visualize common words in positive and negative reviews.
4. Feature Extraction:

TF-IDF: Convert text data into numerical form using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.
Word Embeddings: Utilize embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe for richer representations.
5. Model Building:

Algorithms: Train models using various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Evaluation Metrics: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
6. Model Tuning:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
Cross-Validation: Ensure model generalizes well to unseen data.
7. Sentiment Prediction:

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new reviews.
Output: Classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
8. Visualization and Reporting:

Confusion Matrix: Visualize model performance.
Reports: Generate detailed reports on model performance and findings.
9. Deployment:

API: Create an API using Flask or Django for real-time sentiment analysis.
Web App: Develop a web interface for users to input reviews and get sentiment predictions.
